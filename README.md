## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Today, people's living standards are improving, so the demand for tourism is increasing. People travelling often have difficulty accessing local services such as entertainment venues, cafes, events, booking tickets, etc. TIKA aims to make the above process easier. Moreover, TIKA also helps service providers and kiosk implementers to add income from service revenue.
